\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background and scope}
Let's begin by presenting a general overview, during which we'll go through the key-terms needed to understand this project.

When faced with a given cryptocurrency, what we see on a price chart is the value of a single \textbf{token}.
The value of a token is equal to the market cap (total value of the network) of a currency divided by the total circulating supply (number of tokens).
Bitcoin has a circulating supply of 19 million tokens but a total supply of 21 million tokens. The difference between the circulating supply and the total supply is the amount still available to be mined, and indicates future inflation. 
\[
Token_{BTC}=\frac{MC_{current}}{CS_{current}}
\]
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale = 0.7]{TestPlots/BTC_overview.png}
    \caption{}
    \label{}
\end{figure}
\\
Just by looking at this chart, one can realise how volatile bitcoin has been and this particularity is shared by many other cryptocurrencies.\\
Bitcoin went from $10K\$$ in September 2020 to over $60K\$$ in April 2021, but also lost half of it's value from April to July 2021.
One can say without doubt that the prices are on a roller coaster, everyone wants to experience the upward trends however the downfalls are extremely scary.\\

Of course, not all cryptos follow the same trends some might be rising while others are crashing, and the goal of crypto-trading is to ride the right wave at the right time, and jump off the ship before it sinks. That is why we will be dealing with crypto pairs which are explained further.\\
The prices fluctuate according to many variables such as news, regulations, announcements, general sentiment etc... Of course risk is involved and that's why the best way to navigate these dangerous waters is to have a set plan and the right logic to follow.







\section{Aim}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
The goal of this project is to proceed to the analysis of an optimal trading (buy-and-sell) strategy for the market of Cryptocurrencies. We expect such a strategy, if successful, also applicable to the case of traditional stock markets. (note: Cryptocurrencies data are usually more easily and freely available than stock markets data, which are often pricey)
    \item
The first part of the project will consist in showing you how to access the data of all historical data available on Binance. We choose Binance because it is one, if not the only exchange, with a properly working API which also have historical data up to 2017 and for the widest range of cryptocurrency pairs, and therefore the most diverse range of applicable trading strategy (arbitrage, sentiment-driven prices, trends, market making, etc).
    \item{
If you don't want to get your hands dirty (which is understandable) navigating through the code to download the data, simply download a set of the data at this link : \url{https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/URDxQbEv8LqSkB2}}

\end{itemize}



\section{The data}
\subsection{Data extraction and processing}
.

\begin{itemize}
\item{To extract the data, you can do so as per the call of \begin{center}\code{getuptodate\_binance\_data.update\_data\_for\_basepair(base\_pair=\'USDT\', nb\_symbols\_limit=5, bin\_size=\'1d\')}\end{center} in \code{get\_ohlc\_historical\_data.ipynb}}.

\item{The data will be saved in a folder named \code{Binance\_OHLC} located within a 'Data' folder within your project folder. If you do not have such folders, create some. (If you are familiar with \code{chdir} python function to change and work with your choice directory you can ignore this remark).}

\item{The code in \code{get\_uptodate\_binance\_data.py} contains a global variable \code{main\_directory} which has the name of my project folder I am working on. I recommend you call your project folders with the same name.}
\end{itemize}




\begin{itemize}
    \item 
We use the \code{clean\_csv} function to clean the newly downloaded data file. In particular, we setup timestamp in datetime format, to allow us to have an easier handling of the data later on.
    \item
We also select a subset of the columns of interest to us. In particular we keep keep the following columns: ['timestamp', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume', 'time\_diff\_in\_days', 'time\_diff\_in\_min'].
    \item
Note that we have never encountered any NA values or other seemingly out-of-place values that would need to be rejected. Indeed, so called 'out-of-place values' or any other outliers kind of value are strong indicators which require further investigations and may be relevant to dedicated algorithmic trading strategies. We absolutely do not want to remove them as we may be tempted to do in some other contexts in data science.
    \item
Discrepancies in the timestamp of our data : Missing time periods. Every once in a while there is a major crash in cryptocurrencies market (i.e. prices dropping significantly). This leads to a massive amount of people trying to connect to the cryptocurrencies exchange platforms to try to sell (or buy) some cryptocurrencies.This often results in the exchange becoming unavailable, their server not being able to handle so many connections attempts at once. This explains the missing data in historical cryptocurrencies prices data (It can be for a couple of minutes up to a couple of hours). We therefore compute 'time\_diff\_in\_days' and 'time\_diff\_in\_min' to spot any such discrepancies in the timestamp.
    \item
You can find the code in the \code{get\_uptodate\_binance\_data.py} file

\end{itemize}

It is important to note that sometimes the dataset obtained via the extraction in Python can have missing rows of data, i.e. a time series with some missing dates/times depending on the resolution of the data set. As our analyses will be making decisions at every time step in the relevant dataset, this is inconvenient. One way to circumvent this is to \textbf{impute} the time series, and there are software packages available to do this. For example, in section \ref{reddit} on Reddit networks, an R package called \code{imputeTS} is used to do this, with the function \code{na\_kalman} which replaces \code{NA} values in the dataset using nearby values by Kalman Smoothing []. This method is one of the most recommended in the package [],

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Reddit_Analysis/Price_Data_Extraction/Data/Binance_OHLC/imputed_gg_1m.png}
    \caption{Imputed values of time series. The graph is generated automatically with the function \code{ggplot\_na\_imputations} in the \code{imputeTS} package.}
    \label{fig:imputations}
\end{figure}


Going further...

\begin{itemize}
    \item 
Once an analysis is performed on a dedicated dataset (e.g. 1 hour BTC/USDT historical data), the same statistical analysis can be performed over any dataset (e.g. 1 minute ETH/CHF historical data), since the data structure (i.e. the columns, open, high, low, close) is the same. We will do so later on in the project.
    \item
We downloaded the data for hundreds of cryptocurrency pairs over various timeframe (1 day, 1 hour, 1 minute, etc) so that we can perform meta-analysis and/or repeat the small single-pair dataset analysis over all other sets

\end{itemize}



\subsection{Data transformation}

The goal of this project is to proceed to the analysis of an optimal trading (buy-and-sell) strategy for the market of Cryptocurrencies. Our analysis will be made on cryptocurrency pairs.\\
These pairs allow us to compare costs between different cryptocurrencies. They are helpful for illustrating the relative worth of coins. For example,the question how much Bitcoin (BTC) equals in Ethereum (ETH) will be answered by the value of the pair BTC/ETH.
In this report we are dealing with the BTC/USDT pair. USDT stands for Tether which is a stable coin in which each token is backed by a U.S Dollar.\\
The price of a token depends on the market cap of the currency and how many tokens are issued. And since there are hundreds of cryptocurrencies dealing with their prices can become very cumbersome and lack clarity. For that very reason, we have chosen to deal in our analysis with log-returns.
Indeed, the price of a currency is not what is of interest to us but rather it's evolution. By studying prices we would be confronted with values that don't have an intrinsic meaning, However with log returns we will have an idea of the evolution in percentages, which is way more useful. To sum it up, this allows measuring a lot of variables in a comparable metric, thus enabling evaluation of analytic relationships amongst two or more variables despite originating from price series of unequal values. \\
Concretely, if we are doing our study on a currency at time $i$ which is valued at price $p_i$. The log-return for the period $t$ is:
$$\log\left(\frac{p_i}{p_{i-t}}\right)$$\\

Another important property is the additivity of the log-return. If our price at $t_1$ is $p_1$, it changes to $p_2$ at $t_2$ and move to $p_3$ at $t_3$. The log return from $t_1 $ to $t_2$ is $\log (p_2) - \log (p_1)$, the log return from $t_2 $ to $t_3$ is $\log (p_3) - \log (p_2)$. Therefore, it is clear that the log return from $t_1 $ to $t_3$ is $\log (p_3) - \log (p_1)$. This can be calculated easily. However, if we use simple return, the return should be $p_3/p_1$ instead of $p_3/p_2 + p_2/p_1$. Hence, log-return is easier to apply to real data.

 An interesting observation one can make when plotting the log-returns is that they are supposed to be normally distributed, however when looking at Figure 1.1 we can see that the mean is slightly tilted to the positive side which indicates that BTC has been a good investment overall.
 
 
 \section{Exploratory data analysis}
Purpose of EDA:
\subsection{Distribution of prices and returns}



\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{Images/Box Plot of Return.png}
    \caption{Box plot of log-return}
    \label{log return box}
\end{subfigure}%

    \caption{7 day rolling average of the volume}
    \label{7day rolling volume}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{A figure with two subfigures}
\label{fig:test}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{log return box} shows the box plot of log-return of BTC. As can be seen from the graph, there are many outliers of the box plot. So it is reasonable to say that the distribution of log-return is not a normal distribution. More evidence will be given in the following sections.



Figure \ref{7day rolling volume} is about 7 days rolling average of the volume. From this figure, we see that the volume oscillate during our examining period. The volume sometime change drastically for a certain day. However, with the existence of up and down signals, we see there is a trend of volume increasing from the beginning of 2017-07 to 2021-07.


\subsection{Mean and Median hourly BTC/USDT log-return by day, by week, and by month}

In the following we show historical hourly log-return based on the trading day, the trading week, or the trading month.
\\ \\
We can notice that historically, Thursday is a bad trading day, and if historical trends are any indication of future trends, we may want to consider avoiding trading on this particular day.
\\ \\
Similarly, we see that the months of March and September are historically quite bad months to trade and we may want (assuming this trend will repeat in the future) selling our BTC assets in the beginning of these months and buying back at the end of these months.
\\ \\
We display the charts below.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Analysis of extremes}

In finance, the question of extreme values is indubitably an important one. For example: stock market crashes, interest rates ad  insurance pricing based on life expectancy are all fields in which it would be necessary to consider rare events. The analysis of cryptocurrency trajectories is no different, indeed, sudden but large deviations in the trajectory of cryptocurrency prices would certainly be of interest to a trader. 

In light of this, it is not unnatural to ask the corresponding statistical question in the context of extremes. In Figure \ref{fig:hist_logreturn_17_21}, we can see that the distribution of log returns for our data set admits very heavy tails. In this dataset there are many statistically anomalous results which skew the data, but even upon their removal, the data remain strongly skewed, see Figure \ref{fig:distplots_sans_outliers}, the data still exhibit this skewed behaviour. This sparks interest in using extreme value theory to aid our understanding of this behaviour.\\

If we observe a trajectory of prices $p_t$, for $t$ an index of time (e.g. prices per minute or hour, etc.), by assuming they come from a random sample, we can aim to fit their scaled extreme, either maximum or minimum, to a distribution of the following type \[
G(x; \eta, \tau, \xi) = \begin{cases}
\exp\left[-\left\{1+\xi(x-\eta)/\tau\right\}_+\right], & \xi \ne 0\\
\exp\left[-\exp\left\{-(x-\eta)/\tau\right\}\right], & \xi = 0,
\end{cases}
\]
where $\eta, \tau$ and $\xi$ are location, shape and scale parameters respectively. Studying maxima in this way is called the \textbf{block maxima approach}, since one groups data and considers fitting the distribution to the maxima across all groups, for example: maximum price over one day, where the prices are indexed by hours.

The goal now, therefore, is to fit this model to our data, i.e. by finding the unknown parameters. To this end, we use the $\code{R}$ package $\code{evd}$ which gives useful functions for extremal modelling and makes plotting diagnostics straightforward.

\chapter{Social media's influence on cryptocurrency prices}
.
\section{Price versus human behaviour}\label{sec:pricevshumanbehaviour}
Some introduction, including some references...
\begin{strategy}[Backtesting for profit and loss]
If in a given time-frame, our entity-of-interest (e.g. person or news agency) outputs content on a media outlet, then the trader buys $1$ ETH at the current price and sells at the end of the time-frame. The time frame could be one second, for example. Thus, we suppose that our portfolio starts with a value $V_0$, and then we increment time. At each step, either we do nothing (no contribution was made by the entity) and so the value of the portfolio does not change, or it is scaled by the ratio of the sell price to the buy price, i.e. let $V_i$ be the value of the portfolio at time step $i$ and $c_i$ the close price at time step $i$, then \[
V_{i+1} = \begin{cases}
\dfrac{c_{i+1}}{c_i}V_i, & \text{entity outputs at time step}\, i,\\
V_i, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\] 
The resulting sequence $(V_i)_i$ is called the profit and loss of the strategy and is often abbreviated to PnL. We will implement this strategy for each media outlet in order to assess the effectiveness, at least superficially, of our algorithm and in turn, the influence of media on cryptocurrency prices. 
\end{strategy} 

\section{Twitter}
Twitter is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages known as "tweets". Users can post, like, and share (or retweet) tweets.
From common people to highly influential billionaires, everyone has something to say and millions of people react and share their opinions on that platform. Donald Trump for instance has used it to communicate with the American citizens during his mandate. And we can say that the influence happening on twitter is unquestionable.\\

Users interact with Twitter through browser or mobile frontend software, however in order to collect data from that platform programmatically one has to do it via its APIs.
We have used the python library snscrape.modules.twitter to collect the data we needed.\\


\section{Medium}
Medium is an American online publishing platform developed by Evan Williams and launched in August 2012. It is owned by A Medium Corporation. The platform is an example of social journalism, having a hybrid collection of amateur and professional people and publications, or exclusive blogs or publishers on Medium, and is regularly regarded as a blog host.

Many cryptocurrencies are ran by companies. These companies keep and matain the currency they create, and they use social media to promote their products. Medium, as a famous and influential social media platform, is often used to publish announcement and news of the company. One of the article says that there is a correlation between the time they publish article and the price of their cryptocurrencies. The currency they analyze is called Kyber (KNC). In this section, we are going to investigate the correlation between them in Kyber.

Below is a brief overview of what we are going to do in this section.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Data Preprocessing\\
    Here, we introduce how we collecet the price data and publication data.
    \item Statistical analysis\\
    After collecting data, we do some statistical analysis to explore our dataset.
    \item Strategy\\
    Knowing the statistical property, we try to use the result we obtained to build a strategy that performs better than the general market.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
In this part, we present the methods to extract data of price change and the medium publication. 

For the medium publication, we use Webscrapping techniques via python libraries (\code{BeautifulSoup4, request} and \code{selenium}). At first, we use request to acquire the source code of the website from \url{https://medium.com/@kyberteam }. With the use of selenium, we scroll the page to the very bottom to reach the full context of the website. After that, we use functions in the library  \code{BeautifulSoup4} to parse the whole source code. With the \code{find\_all} function, we find all content that interests us. In this project, we choose \code{title} and \code{date} as our features.

Another part is the access to the price. Binance gives us an API to access to the cryptocurrency price easily. Binance is a cryptocurrency exchange which is currently the largest exchange in the world in terms of daily trading volume of cryptocurrencies. With the help of Binance API, we are able to extract the details for price changing of a certain cryptocurrency.

After that, we merge two dataframes together. Finally, we get our dataframe that contains feature \code{date},\code{high}(the highest price of the day),\code{low}(the lowest price of the day), \code{open}(the open price of a day), \code{close}(The close price of a day), \code{signal}(It is an indicator of whether Kyber has post an article at that day,\code{volumn}(The money traded at that day). 1 means Kyber post an article on article at that day while 0 means no articles were posted). 

As the Kyber begun to trade on Binance since 2020-06-12, the data we select are between 2020-06-12 to 2021-11-16.




\subsection{Statistical Analysis}
To begin with, we want to find if there are strong correlations between these variables. If we find some strong correlation between the change of price and some feature, we can use that to build a great strategy. As discussed above, we consider the difference of the log price within a day (\code{log(close)-log(open)}, we call this feature \code{opcl}). Unfortunately, we can't find any features that strong correlate with the  Below is the correlation matrix between \code{signal} and \code{opcl}. Unfortunately, there is no strong correlation between them. Below is the table that present the correlation matrix between opcl and signal.

\begin{table}[]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
         & opcl &  signal \\
        opcl & 1.00 & 0.05\\
        signal & 0.05& 1.00\\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Caption}
    \label{tab:my_label}
\end{table}



\subsection{Strategy}
In this section, we try some strategies and do back testing to see if This method performs well. 

Strategy 1: When the signal is 1 (Kyber update an article at that day), we spend all the money to buy the cryptocurrency at that day with the open price and sell them all at the next day with the open price.

Strategy 2: When the signal is 1 (Kyber update an article at that day), we spend all the money to buy the cryptocurrency at that day with the open price and sell them all at the same day with the close price.

We compare the two strategies with a baseline, which is the simplest strategy: buy the cryptocurrency and do nothing. For visualization, we assume we have 1000 dollars at the beginning of the trade.











\section{Reddit}\label{reddit}
Reddit is the Internet's forum. It serves as a hub for discussion on just about anything you can think of. Naturally, therefore, cryptocurrency enthusiasts will discuss trends, advice and more in the many dedicated fora such as 'r/Cryptocurrecy' or 'r/Bitcoin'. For this reason, it is not hard to imagine that there are more prominent members of the community who feature across several fora and make frequent contributions to the community. Over time, these people may gain a reputation for some type of expertise. Such people, like in the Twitter section, we will call  \textbf{influencers}. 

But how can we identify such people? Reddit is largely anonymous, and many important members of the community aren't as easily identifiable as Elon Musk. Therefore, it is important to not treat this question subjectively, since that could lead to the omission of potentially important authors whose contributions to the network of crypto traders have been valued. Consequently, we make a superficial\footnote{due to time constraints} use of network science to locate these users. 

\subsection{Reddit as a social network}\label{sec:redditSN}

Reddit, by definition, is a social network. It connects human beings together through online interaction. Therefore it lends itself to being represented mathematically in this way. However, there are many ways to do this. To list some examples, one could form: a network of fora which share users; a network of users and those who comment on their posts or a network of fora and their users. Each of these cases present distinct sets of network elements: the first, a set of fora; the second, a set of users while the third is an interesting mélange of the two. 

To illustrate the sheer versatility of this approach, and introduce some of the ideas used in our analysis, we begin by forming several networks (or interchangeably, \textit{graphs}) based on subreddits and users centered at the \textbf{r/CryptoCurrency} subreddit. The data were accessed using the extensive \code{praw} library in Python, which is used for webscraping essentially all publicly visible Reddit data. 

Before we begin, let us define some terminology that will be used throughout this section. A \textit{subreddit} is a forum dedicated to a given topic; these terms will be used interchangeably. A user, author or \textit{redditor}, is someone who actively uses reddit by making \textit{submissions} or posting \textit{comments} on those submissions, where the former are posts that start a \underline{discussion} within a subreddit. In this section, we will often work with 'top' posts. These are posts that have been identified as popular or highly rated by Reddit users. If you're not already familiar, please visit the site (\url{www.reddit.com}) and have a look around, there are myriad topics there and indubitably one will catch your eye!\\ 

We will access a set of users who have posted in the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit across the top $500$ submissions in recent history. Their activity in the subreddit is shown in Figure \ref{fig:num_posts_r_crypto}. 

\begin{figure}

Our goal for the moment is exploratory and we will investigate several properties of the users and related subreddits of r/CryptoCurrency. In this context, what do we mean by related? Here, we will also identify the subreddits in which the top authors in r/CryptoCurrency are also active, see Figure \ref{fig:other_subs_contributions} for a vusualisation. It is no surprise that subreddits like r/Bitcoin and r/ethtrader appear, while we also see that r/memes is popular as it is a general, fun forum.

To analyse this structure more deeply, we create a network, $G$, connecting these authors and subreddits. The network is formed in the following way: if redditor $r$ posts in subreddit $s$, then we connect $r$ and $s$ by a \textbf{link}, which we may denote $r \sim s$ (read as: $r$ is linked to $s$). We say that the \textbf{nodes} of this network are the elements connected via a link. One should notice that a network constructed in this way has a special property. It is possible to separate the set of nodes $V$ of $G$ into two disjoint groups or \textbf{categories} $R$ and $S$ where there exist no links between pairs of nodes where each node belongs to the same set: such networks are called \textbf{bipartite}.

The substructures of networks of this type are often of interest to analysts; indeed, bipartite networks admit two \textit{projections} which reveal the underlying structure. For example, we can form a network between subreddits, $s, s' \in S$, where $s \sim s'$ whenever there is an $r$ such that $r \sim s$ and $r\sim s'$. In words: if a redditor has posted in both subreddits $s$ and $s'$, then we can create an edge between them, producing the graphs in Figure \ref{fig:bipartite}.

What can we learn from the projections? Later in this section, our goal will be to find nodes which are considered to be important or influential within a network. As a result we need a method to assign some degree of importance or \textbf{centrality} to the nodes (or links). Some measures of centrality are detailed in Table \ref{table:centralityMeasures}. To understand the need for this variety in measures imagine the following scenario: you are studying transatlantic internet traffic and its router network. The idea here is that even while the most naive measure of importance of a node, its \textbf{degree} (number of links the node has), might not be very large, it may have important positioning in the network. : routers connecting the US and the UK will be very important to this network and will separate two \textbf{communities}, even if in those communities their degree is not as high as elsewhere. It is these nodes one might wish to identify (using betweenness centrality, for example) - they are important relative to the context of the network.

However, for other measures, like eigenvector centrality, we see that the other subreddits listed here have relatively high scores considering the centrality of Cryptocurrency, and so are frequented a lot by redditors, comparatively speaking.}

\end{figure}
We now use the ideas presented in section \ref{sec:redditSN} to identify the most influential reddit authors present in $n=24$ popular subreddits. We begin by constructing an author--commenter network, where we form a \textbf{directed} graph such that if redditor $r$ comments on a post of redditor $r'$ then $r \rightarrow r'$. Indeed, we encode now each link with a direction, hence the term \textbf{directed} network. We achieved this via the \code{praw} library by extracting the top $~400$ posts in the cryptocurrency related subreddits combined with their author and comment data. 



To study and visualise the graph, we explored the R packages \code{igraph}, \code{ggraph}, \code{visNetwork}, \code{graphlayouts} [...] extensively. Moreover, a very recent development in the field of network science has constructed the centrality measure, \textbf{Integrated Value of Influence} (IVI) \cite{IVIpatterns}, which uses various statistical tests to compare various centrality measures for a graph to determine the most influential nodes, see page $4$ of \cite{IVIpatterns}. Fortunately, the authors of that paper have created a comprehensive R package called \code{influential} whose function \code{ivi} does the heavy lifting for us, find a vignette describing its function in \cite{IVIvignette}. This function will calculate the various centrality measures for us, compute the IVI for each node, which is scaled to lie between $0$ and $100$. To explore our results, please visit our Rshiny application \textbf{\url{https://kcvis.shinyapps.io/network_analysis/}} to play around interactively with the network formed and discover properties of its nodes. 



As you see from the RShiny application, the author with the highest IVI centrality is \code{naji\_102} and a further application of \code{praw} functionality shows that the majority of their posts occur in ethereum related subreddits, so we focus on the pairing ETHUSDT for this redditor. The analysis thence effectuated consisted of applying the strategy outlined in section \ref{sec:pricevshumanbehaviour} to the posts of this redditor between Aug 8 and Nov 11 of 2021\footnote{The reason for this choice is computational; we extracted as many popular posts as the webscraper \code{praw} would permit --- it limits use so that their servers are not overrun.}, in Python. We do this twice: once by measuring posts by hour, and again but by measuring posts by minute, then we compare the results. The nature of the strategy produces a step-like trajectory in each case, as observed in Figure \ref{fig:pnl_naji102}. We can see that the two strategies exhibit quite different behaviours over the identical time period.




To compare their performance, we study their distribution. Plotting histograms of the data, we observe that the data for hourly and minute-wise data are bimodal and trimodal respectively, with gaussian-resembling shapes. Therefore, to draw some conclusions from the model we fit a gaussian mixture to each set of PnL data of the form \[
\sum_{j=1}^N \lambda_{i,j}\phi(x;\,\mu_{i,j},\, \sigma_{i,j})
\]
for $(i,N) \in {(h,2), (m,3)}$, where if $h$ and $m$ denote hourly and minute-wise data respectively. As standard, $\phi$ is a gaussian density. Moreover the weights (or probabilities) \[
\sum_{j=1}^N \lambda_{i,j} = 1
\]
for each $i$ and each $\lambda_{()}$ belongs to the unit interval.

    \caption{Some fitting diagnostics for the mixture model. The underlying histograms of the data are shown in grey on the right.

The coloured densities are the components of the mixture - they seem to capture the data well.}

R has a package \code{mixtools} which contains a function \code{normalmixEM} which computes the parameter estimation for a given parameter $k$ number of gaussians in the mixture. The results of this estimation are given in Tables \ref{table:paramesthr} and \ref{table:paramestmin} and some diagnostics in Figure \ref{fig:mixture_model_fitting}.

\label{table:paramestmin}
\end{table}

Confidence intervals for the parameters were found through bootstrapping since this is the simplest way to derive confidence intervals for various quantities in the quite invovled EM algorithm and it is equally as informative, we performed this calculation manually in R.

Indeed, these estimates are suggestive. Firstly, for the hourly data, the mean of the fitted model is less than $1000$ ($981.80$) which gives an indication that our algorithm underperforms over this period, as we are on average at a loss, while the minute-wise data gives a more optimisitic outlook. One potential reason for this is that the minute-wise strategy acts on a higher resolution than the hourly model and so is more sensitive to changes potentially caused or augmented by the comments of the author(s) we have identified and so captures the profit making opportunities more effectively.

\vspace{-1.5em}
\end{table}


To conclude, we calculate from $1000$ samples the bootstrapped $95\%$ confidence intervals for the mean of each set of PnL data. For hourly and minute-wise data respectively they are the following: $(980.916, 982.677)$ and $(1006.420, 1006.478)$. We remark that the former does not contain the estimated mean of the distribution but the lower limit is indeed very close to it. More noticeably, the former interval does not contain $1000$, so we tend to underperform with an hourly approach.

This analysis is of course limited. For example, we didn't consider the content of the posts, and we performed the analysis of a relatively short time frame. But this is analysis is intended to be informative. Going further, we would aim to continue this analysis for various authors and various (longer) time frames to build a much more comprehensive strategy which encompasses all the information we glean from that analysis, nevertheless, what we observe here is promising, and certainly supports the use of network modelling to identify important members of communities. Moreover, in an even more precise analysis, it would serve to organise posts by words mentioned in them, then we can make decisions based on the content of posts and not their existence alone.
